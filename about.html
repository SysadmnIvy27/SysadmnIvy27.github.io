        <h1>About</h1>
        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>Hi, my name is Augustus, and I'm a junior at Lawrenceburg High School and a student of Ivy Tech Community College in Lawrenceburg Indiana. This site has been a project of mine for the past four months, and it aims to provide a suitable place for my family to access sites and plan things out together.</p>
        <h2>FAQ</h2>
        <h3>Q: Why this site?</h3>
        <p>A: I wanted to create something personalized and tailored to our family unlike Nextcloud, and sometimes the easiest way to make something you like is to do it yourself.</p>
        <h3>Q: Will more features be added in the future?</h3>
        <p>A: No, the site is meant to be barebones and to the point. Small tweaks may be added, but otherwise no major features or new pages will be added unless absolutly necessary.</p>
        <h3>Q: How do I find the family events?</h3>
        <p>A: Look under the family calender found <a href="calender.html">here</a>.</p>
